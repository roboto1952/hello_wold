hmm so you need a description to know what this is?
the tutorial did not even tell me to edit the readme so this is overtime

so in this branch i lament the almost total failure of me going through the 'get started' tutorial

besides that i tell people some things about myself

or am i in a weird way i am conflicted about that so i am sticking to

common place things that dont really tell u anything about me

i play football 

i dont know what to do with my time

i should probably try harder in life

i should try to find out what 'try harder ' means and then i should do it

i am interested in changing the actions of people, of me, of others

for the right reasons, for reasons of hybris, for money, to achieve a utopic state in society.

know that i read the text above i seem to have failed at not disclosing much about myself

yet i have no problem for others to read what i have written. makes me wonder what i meant with 'tell u anything about me'.
